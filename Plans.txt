GOAL
    Build a "Character Sorter" that takes a group of "Rateables" and returns a sorted list

            Intended "sorted" order would be a list where the favorite characters are first and the least favorite last, however
            the output is dependent on how the user interacts with the quiz so "sorted" is whatever metric the user uses
            **For parity throughout the notes, I will assume assume the ideal sorted order is one where "rateables" are in order
            of most liked to least liked**

            Rateables will be a class holding the information of each character or thing capable of being put in the list
            Each object will have the fields [name, image,[tags]] where tags is a list of strings
                Tags will be used to allow users to manually select characters to compare, or select curated sets
            Users will be able to create their own characters to put into the program
                Wether pre-set sets will be hardcoded in or wether user created sets will be possible will be figured out later

            Sorting will use a series of "choose one" questions between two characters to decide placement in the list
            A elo based system will be attempted first, with initial questions making large movements in elo with questions later
            in the process refining the placements
                "full sort" and "quick sort" options will be available
                "full sort" will perform all relevant comparisons and provide a fully sorted list
                "quick sort" will ask about half as many questions as full sort for the sake of time, and may be less accurate
                but will still have high accuracy within the top portion of the sort
